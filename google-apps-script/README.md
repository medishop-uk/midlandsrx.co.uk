## Data flow

- A basket request is written to orders before the customer is redirected to WhatsApp or Telegram.
- Duplicate order IDs are ignored.
- New reviews are written to reviews-ratings with Pending status.
- Only Approved reviews are returned publicly.
- Reviewer email addresses are never returned by the public endpoint.
